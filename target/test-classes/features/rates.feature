Feature: Exchange Rates
  As a User
  I want to be able to have an automated testing framework available which covers different scenarios for the Rates API
  So that I can make sure that the APIâ€™s are fit for purpose in the use of the exchange rate for financial reasons

  Scenario: Validate API availability for Latest Foreign Exchange rates
    Given I have access to Foreign Exchange rates api
    When I GET the latest foreign exchange rates
    Then I should see the HTTP response code as 200

  Scenario: Validate invalid API response for Latest Foreign Exchange rates
    Given I have invalid api for Foreign Exchange rates
    When I GET the latest foreign exchange rates
    Then I should see the HTTP response code as 400

  Scenario Outline: Validate API response for Latest Foreign Exchange rates
    Given I have access to Foreign Exchange rates api
    When I GET the latest foreign exchange rates
    Then I should see the HTTP <response body>
